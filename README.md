# CmlLib.Core.AOTCompatible
An AOT-Compatible version of CmlLib.Core.
**P.S.** This is susceptible to issues, I have not gone through the entire project and made sure of everything being AOT Compatible. **This is NOT an official CmlLib project.**

I'd also like to mention, if issues were found, I will probably fix them. I personally use this for my own AOT-Compatible client, and I needed to turn CmlLib.Core compatible.
Credits to [AlphaBs](https://github.com/AlphaBs) and [CmlLib](https://github.com/CmlLib/) for making this in the first place.

Contributions are appreciated, Thank you.
