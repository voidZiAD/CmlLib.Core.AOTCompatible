An AOT-Compatible version of the entirety of CmlLib & XboxAuthNet.
**P.S.** This is susceptible to issues, but for the most part I have checked for any reflection-based Serialization/Deserialization and modified it to make sure it worked for AOT native projects. **This is NOT an official CmlLib/XboxAuthNet project.**

I'd also like to mention, if issues were found, I will probably fix them. I personally use this for my own AOT-Compatible client, and I needed to turn CmlLib and XboxAuthNet compatible.
Credits to [AlphaBs](https://github.com/AlphaBs) and [CmlLib](https://github.com/CmlLib/) for making this in the first place.

Contributions are appreciated, Thank you.

Example/Sample usage can be found on [CmlLib.Core](https://github.com/CmlLib/CmlLib.Core).
